This page was created as a part of the Social Data Analysis and Visualization course at DTU (02806, Spring '22 offering). The article is meant to tell a narrative story, incorporating a green aspect into it as well, as per this years topic.

The jupiter notebook explaining our motivation and all of the steps done along with the code is located in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jeyjey626/social-data-sources). This directory also contains other files necessary for the project completion.

Two data sets used can be found in the following links:
1.  [New York City Bike Routes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/New-York-City-Bike-Routes/7vsa-caz7?fbclid=IwAR1qhBBuDYaDo53woGk00lEG5IXKk9mrOp2seCaARmlS_Ga_Ifk7046Si7U)
2.  [City bike trips](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html?fbclid=IwAR15trP4MTHZSkcCqpxBBYtCJLGnAEycwRhWPrYct6QuMSstojYqAamT_D8)

They are also referenced in the aforementioned jupiter notebook.
